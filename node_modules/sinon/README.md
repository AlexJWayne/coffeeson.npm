Standalone and test framework agnostic JavaScript test spies, stubs and mocks.

## Installation 

via [npm (node package manager)](http://github.com/isaacs/npm)

    $ sudo npm install sinon

or install via git by cloning the repository and including sinon.js 
in your project, as you would any other third party library.

## Usage

See the [sinon project homepage](http://cjohansen.no/sinon/)

## Goals

* No global pollution
* Easy to use
* Require minimal “integration”
* Easy to embed seamlessly with any testing framework
* Easily fake any interface
* Ship with ready-to-use fakes for XMLHttpRequest, timers and more

## Running tests on Rhino

I've added a rudimentary setup for running the tests on Rhino with env.js (as
this is a fairly common test setup, Sinon should support it). The files are
located in test/rhino, but there are currently quite a few test failures. I
believe these are not all bugs - many are probably problems with the tests
running in Rhino. Run tests from the project root (load paths depend on it):

    $ java -jar js.jar -opt -1 test/rhino/run.js
